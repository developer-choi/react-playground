/**
 * There is absolutely no reason to provide the second generic parameter of GetServerSideProps.
 * Because it is a static route. (Look at the file name)
 * So the type of context params should be deduced as undefined, which is a very natural result.
 *
 * But daringly, the type of params is ParsedQuery | Just because it is inferred as undefined, there is no reason to modify this.
 * Because there is no need to use the params property itself, there is no reason to receive type inference.
 *
 * Therefore, you only need to use the properties of other contexts, not params.
